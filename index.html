            <h1 id = "top">How to Study for Your Algebra Exam as a Visual Learner!</h1>
            <ul>
                <h3>If you're...</h3>
                <li>Reading this, you probably have an exam or assessment around the corner, and have no idea how to prepare. It may seem daunting to try 
                    and study for a subject that requires problem solving, since its not so straighfoward to study a skill. These set of instructions considers math
                    and specifically algebra as a skill, a problem solving skill. Since algebra is the start of harder mathematics for most people, it may be hard to
                    get the ball rolling when studying, or it may seem even impossible to comprehend thinking about algebra in a study focused manner. If you are a visual 
                    learner, you prefer visual aids, and as a whole think in pictures. Sometimes prone to missing the small details. This will be a guide for you to unlock
                    your abilities to learn, and to open up a new way to practice this skill.  
                </li>

                <li>Asking what's the point in studying if it's skill based, then you would be asking the right question. A great way to study for algebra,
                    would be to learn this skill. In order to learn a skill, you would need step-by-step instructions, similar to how to ride a bike, how to play a card game,
                    or how to cook a recipe. Obviously, skills require context. If you're learning a card game, you should know what face cards, number cards, and jokers all
                    mean before learning the game. Algebra may be a difficult course to understand, but an exam or assessment requires a majority of problem solving. As a 
                    visual learner, studying math may make no sense for your specific learning qualities, so with context and by following these instructions, you will attain
                    methods of problem solving that work well visually.
                </li>

                <li>Ready to start, make sure to have your notes ready. Since problem solving requires context for the problem, I suggest reading the material
                    that will be on the exam or having them nearby as notes. Your exam may not allow notes, but similar to cooking by a recipe, you get the hang of it
                    after following the recipe once or twice. After understanding the material comes the application. The point of your assessment is to check your understanding
                    and one of the best ways in doing so is by having you apply them, in this case, with problem solving.

                    The first thing you should do before following the steps is to identify an algebra problem to solve. You will ideally repeat these steps for
                    every problem identified.

                                        be located in the same spot as the red equation from the picture to the right.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Now that you have practiced using some visual learner appropriate methods for problem solving, also known as, studying for an algebra exam, hopefully you
                are able to walk away from these instructions more confident in your ability to solve algebraic questions. You will crush this exam!
            </p>
            <p>If you correctly followed the steps, and have used these instructions at least 5-10 times, you should have a stronger grasp in problem solving. You should
                be able to recognize some traits about your learning style, some may include visual pattern recognition, or seeing the big picture.
            </p>

                <h3>Still having issues?</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You may be a different type of learner. The 4 major types include: Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic. With enough funding, a revision
                            of these instructions with multiple types of learning would be available for use.
                        </li>
                        <li>You may not click with the specific methods gone over in the instructions. Methods to learning, retaining, and developing skills aren't uniform
                            for everyone. The methods covered are my favorites as a visual learner, but hopefully you can see the bigger picture and develop some methods
                            that truly work for you.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>What next?</h3>
                <p>If you are confident in your skills, great! You still should practice these methods on all questions, of a variety of types. Some problems may not fit exactly
                    to the methods you practice, it is always a great idea to plan for edge cases.
